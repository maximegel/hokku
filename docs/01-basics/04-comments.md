# Comments

Here's a _line comment_:

```txt
# hello, world
```

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

```txt
lucky_number = 7 # I'm feeling lucky today
```

But you'll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it's annotating:

```txt
# I'm feeling lucky today
lucky_number = 7
```

Here's a _block comment_:

```txt
##
Some explanation
with more details

```
