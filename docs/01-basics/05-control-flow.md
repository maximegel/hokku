# Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on if a condition is true, or run some
code repeatedly while a condition is true, are basic building blocks in most
programming languages.

## Conditions

To branch your code depending on conditions, use the `if` and `else` functions:

```txt
print_condition =
    if 3 < 5
    then print "The condition is true"
    else print "The condition is false"

print_condition
```
